# TypeScript Bug: Passing Array to Function Expecting String

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: passing an array to a function that expects a string.  The `greeter` function is designed to take a string argument, but the code attempts to pass an array.  This results in a compilation error.

The solution involves type checking and potentially modifying the function signature or data structure to handle arrays correctly.
